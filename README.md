# The Imposter Game 🎭

A simple in-person party game you play on your phone or computer.

One player is the imposter.  
Everyone else knows the secret word.

Pass the phone, give one-word clues, and vote people out until the imposter is caught — or survives to the end.

## How to Play
- Add players
- Pass the phone to see roles
- Give one-word clues out loud
- Vote after each round
- Ties skip elimination
- Final 2 with the imposter = imposter wins
