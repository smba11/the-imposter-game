🎭 The Imposter Game

Welcome to The Imposter Game — a fast-paced party game of lies, vibes, and bad acting.

One of you is secretly the Imposter.
Everyone else knows the secret word.

Your job?
Figure out who’s faking it before it’s too late.

🕵️ How It Works

Add players and start the round.

Pass the phone 📱 — each player secretly sees their role.

Most players see the secret word

One unlucky player is the Imposter (no word 👀)

In real life, take turns giving one-word clues about the word.

Be helpful… but not obvious.

The Imposter must blend in and survive.

Vote on who you think the Imposter is.

Votes are public.

If there’s a tie, no one is eliminated.

The game continues:

✅ Group wins if the Imposter is voted out.

😈 Imposter wins if they survive until the final two.

⚠️ Rules to Remember

Never say the secret word out loud.

One-word clues only.

Bluffing is allowed. Lying is encouraged.

If you sound too confident… people will notice.
